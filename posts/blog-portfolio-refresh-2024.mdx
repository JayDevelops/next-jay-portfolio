## Overview

From my current new employment as a fullstack developer,
through life getting hit hard on myself, furthering my education in graduate school,
countless hours of research, failed libraries that did not fit my needs
and many various things that occur to all of us this redesign/overhaul of
my portfolio and new blog has finally been released.

First off I wanted to breathe a new life to my old portfolio that I will update
here and most likely archive to link here so I can always keep improving my current site
as I always find myself working on this mostly during my free time.
Moving away from Sanity CMS and some database needs was a huge need I wanted from my new revised version
of this site, so updating content was a bit of a big pain-point for me.

The flexibility to add custom react components right within my blog entries and custom code snippets
were something I wanted.
Therefore, a lot of my research ended up to ContentLayer,
but sadly, the project <Link href="https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/651#issuecomment-2030335434" external>seems to be out of commission for the time being.</Link>

<Link href="https://www.content-collections.dev/" external> Content Collections{" "}</Link>
seems like the best alternative but did not fit my needs as of something I wanted,
but I highly recommend it if you do not want to take the "mdx remote" approach. However,
given the bit of stubbornness I tend to lean into, I decided to use plain old MDXRemote
which fit very well with what I wanted to write out these blogs and keep them updated
for the long road ahead. A lot of this inspiration came from the now <Link href="https://archive.leerob.io/blog/2023#content-management" external> archived blog from Lee Robinson </Link>
, so big kudos to his approach of content management and incorporating static site
generation from Next.js.


## Seamless Blog Routing From MDX
Choosing MDX was ideal for me as I wanted to be able to pass in any JSX component within my content and be able to render it within my blog content,
this way I can display code snippets and show what the code is doing (if I do not get lazy hehe :p). 

All the fun for the blog generation happens in the `/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` where Next.js <Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes" external>handles creating dynamic routes</Link>
from the passed in params. On this path, it will look up the slug file path within my the content folder named "/posts"
and pass in the required blog pieces such as title, content, etc.
```javascript
  //  get blog attributes from our helper blogMdxUtils utils function within [slug]/page.tsx
  const { title, description, date, index, content } =
    await getMDXContentAndFrontMatter(source);
```

You can take a closer look at the above method call <Link href="https://github.com/JayDevelops/next-jay-portfolio" external>the open source code</Link>,
but what it is doing it is using `compileMDX` call from `MDXRemote` to grab the content and front matter of each .mdx file then I pass them into a layout 
and their respective components. 

To ensure fast loading times for each blog article, `generateStaticParams` method to build out each blog slug route as a static page which is ran on build time.
It allows the content to be grabbed from the server already as html to acomplish great SEO, performance, etc.


```javascript
// generateStaticParams will build each blog slug route as a static page on build time
export const generateStaticParams = async () => {
  const blogPostFilePaths = await getPostFilePaths("/posts");

  return blogPostFilePaths.map((path) => ({
    slug: path.replace(/.mdx?$/, ""),
  }));
};
```

## Passing in Components to MDX Articles
To note, MDX does not know what components are until you explicitly tell them what they are since it does not have access to it so it will not render JSX.
In the `/components/MDXComponents` folder, I have created a `MDXComponents.tsx` file where I explicitly pass in the JSX components I plan to use within my MDX articles
allowing the MDX to render the JSX components correctly.

A great example is rendering out a button that says <Button>I am a Button</Button>, which is a button that does not do anything.
By default the button will not render unless it is passed and explicltiy specified, therefore I pass the Button from my UI components folder
and return the button with the same props as the parent component to then render the `<Button>` component.
```JSX
  import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
  /* rest of code*/
  Button: ({ ...props }) => (
    <Button {...props} />
  ),
  /* rest of code*/
```

This goes onto my next point, where I took high note from Lee Robinson so huge credits to him, is I wanted a table of contents for each blog article. A lot of
plugins did exist for this such as <Link href="https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings">rehype-autolink-headings</Link> but is no fun because this appears
at the top of your content and has some drawbacks. I decided to take Lee Robinson's approach where he creates react components to autolink h1 through h6 headings 
and place them within the slugified id which is exactly what I needed.
```JSX
const Heading = ({
  level,
  children,
  ...props
}: { level: number }) => {
  /* grab the children inside the markdown html file 
  /* to slugify that text such as `## Section One ` turns to section-two */
  const slug = slugify(children?.toString() ?? "");

  return React.createElement(
    `h${level}`,
    { id: slug, ...props },
    React.createElement(
      "a",
      {
        href: `#${slug}`,
        className: "no-underline hover:underline",
      },
      children
    )
  );
};
```
```tsx
export function MDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    h1: ({ ...props }) => <Heading level={1} {...props} />,
    h2: ({ ...props }) => <Heading level={2} {...props} />,
    h3: ({ ...props }) => <Heading level={3} {...props} />,
    h4: ({ ...props }) => <Heading level={4} {...props} />,
    h5: ({ ...props }) => <Heading level={5} {...props} />,
    h6: ({ ...props }) => <Heading level={6} {...props} />,
  /* rest of components being passed */
```
For each h1 to h6 heading, we are adding a link anchor tag with headings of the MDX file then plopping it into the heading id and the internal anchor tag for each page.
An example in markdown is we can have a heading of "## I am a heading" where it will create an h2 tag with the slugified id and interal link,
the markdown will turn into the following html.
```html
 <h2 id="i-am-a-heading">
  <a href="#i-am-a-heading">I am a heading</a>
 </h2>
```

Now it is as simple as extracting the headings from the each MDX file, finding the id and following similar logic to slugifiying each heading to an ID and into a list item
for my table of components therefore it will live as it's own React Component to freely place it anywhere onto my page! (The table of contents is on the left) :)

## Comments Section
On each comment section, I am using Giscus which relies on GitHub to link up announcements channel and be able to comment from your own GitHub account. It was fairly simple to implement
as <Link href="https://giscus.app/" external>you can create your configuration</Link> then place it right within each rendered blog article from the provided slugified path name.


## Self Hosting Deployment
Yes, I did leave Vercel for hosting my personal portfolio and it was a decision between to choose my content to live somewhere else such as a CDN or look into self hosting options such as coolify.
Spoiler warning, I did not go with a CDN or a content management system. I do not plan to never use Vercel again but other side projects I have in mind just seem to be better routed to 
a self hosted option, therefore I switched to coolify and forked up some monthly money for these reasons.
1. Better cost savings for me
2. Hopefully shelling out money makes me build "cooler" side projects
3. I can say "I self host btw"



## Closing Statements
I still want to be able to add more onto my portfolio and blog such as implementing a view counter when a user reads one of my blogs.
I have also left out a lot of the inner workings on my blog/portfolio website itself so if you like for me 
to post an in more depth article, then feel free to comment but as always 
you can take <Link href="https://github.com/JayDevelops/next-jay-portfolio" external>a look at this blog's source code.</Link>

Until next time! :)
