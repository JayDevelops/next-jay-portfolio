## The Rise of Server-Side Rendering

One of the key features that sets **Next.js** apart is its seamless integration of server-side rendering (SSR) with React.
By rendering the initial page on the server, Next.js ensures that your application loads quickly,
providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
This approach also enhances search engine optimization (SEO) by making your content easily accessible to web crawlers.

## Complete example with TailwindCSS

In addition to SSR, Next.js offers the ability to generate static sites, which can significantly improve performance
and reduce server load. By pre-rendering pages at build time, Next.js can serve content directly from a CDN,
resulting in lightning-fast load times for your users.

### Optimized for the Edge
Next.js has been designed with edge computing in mind, allowing you to deploy your applications closer to your users for even faster response times.
This edge-optimized approach, combined with features like Incremental Static Regeneration, ensures that your website remains up-to-date and responsive,
even with high traffic loads.

## Seamless Routing and API Integration
Next.js provides a seamless routing system that makes it easy to manage complex application structures.
Additionally, the framework's built-in support for API routes simplifies the process of integrating backend services
with your frontend, enabling you to create powerful, full-stack applications.

```css
[data-nextjs-scroll-focus-boundary] {
  height: 100%;
}
```


```tsx
import { FC, PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import { Raleway, Merriweather_Sans } from "@next/font/google";

const raleway = Raleway({
  variable: "--display-font",
});

const merriweather = Merriweather_Sans({
  variable: "--body-font",
});

const RootLayout: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => (
  <html className={`${raleway.variable} ${merriweather.variable}`}>
    <body>
      {children}
    </body>
  </html>
)
```

```python hello.py
print("Rendered with Code Hike")
```

## Conclusion
As the web development landscape continues to evolve, Next.js emerges as a powerful and versatile framework
that empowers developers to create exceptional user experiences. By embracing the capabilities of Next.js,
you can unlock new levels of performance, scalability, and developer productivity,
positioning your web applications for success in the modern digital landscape.
