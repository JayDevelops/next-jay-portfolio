## The Rise of Server-Side Rendering

One of the key features that sets **Next.js** apart is its seamless integration of server-side rendering (SSR) with React.
By rendering the initial page on the server, Next.js ensures that your application loads quickly,
providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
This approach also enhances search engine optimization (SEO) by making your content easily accessible to web crawlers.

## Complete example with TailwindCSS

In addition to SSR, Next.js offers the ability to generate static sites, which can significantly improve performance
and reduce server load. By pre-rendering pages at build time, Next.js can serve content directly from a CDN,
resulting in lightning-fast load times for your users.
